title: Malicious programs could intercept messages
desc: |-
  Some malicious programs could intercept the messages of other programs in two ways:
  * by treating itself as an instance of an instance, eg. core.irb#e4d876ce#face8888 because of the way Suds::AppCollection#find works.
  * by using the same full name, because Suds-Daemon currently won't block duplicate names.
